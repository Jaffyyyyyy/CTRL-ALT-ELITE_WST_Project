# Project Rules

This document outlines the rules and constraints for the project.

## Code Style & Generation
*   **Simplicity:** Code should be simple, as if written by a beginner with basic HTML/CSS knowledge.
*   **No AI Signature:** The code should not look like it was generated by an AI.
*   **No Comments:** Do not add comments to the code.
*   **No Templates:** Do not copy-paste pre-built templates or component libraries.
*   **No AI for Whole Components:** AI code-generation for entire components is not allowed.

## Allowed Technologies
*   **HTML5:** Use semantic tags and ARIA where needed.
*   **CSS3:** Plain CSS and CSS variables are allowed.
*   **JavaScript:** ES6+ is allowed, but without any transpilers or build tools.
*   **Bootstrap 5:** Must be used via CDN (both CSS and JS bundle).
*   **Assets:** Locally served assets (images/SVG) that are either created by the user or are free with attribution.
*   **Storage:** `LocalStorage`, `SessionStorage`, and static JSON files for demo data are okay.

## Not Allowed Technologies
*   **JS Frameworks/Libs:** No React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Alpine, jQuery, Lodash, Axios, etc.
*   **CSS Frameworks:** No CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap (e.g., Tailwind, Bulma).
*   **Icons:** No Bootstrap Icons or any other icon/font library via CDN. Instead, use inline SVG/Unicode or locally hosted SVGs.
*   **Build Tools:** No `npm`, `yarn`, `vite`, `webpack`, `gulp`.
*   **Server-Side:** No server-side code or external APIs (like Firebase or headless CMS).
