## How to Run the Project

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Ensure that all assets (CSS, images) are in their respective folders as described above.

## Future Enhancements

### JavaScript Integration
- JavaScript files will be added to the `scripts/` folder.
- These scripts will handle dynamic functionality such as:
  - Form validation
  - Queue management logic
  - Advisor portal interactivity

### Bootstrap Integration
- Bootstrap is already included via CDN for styling.
- Future enhancements will include:
  - Customizing Bootstrap components for a unique look.
  - Adding interactive elements like modals, tooltips, and carousels.

### Comments in Code
- HTML files include comments to explain the structure and purpose of each section.
- CSS files will include comments for each style block.
- JavaScript files will include comments for each function and logic block.

## Notes
- Ensure that the `styles/` and `scripts/` folders are not empty when deploying the project.
- Use the `images/` folder for all image assets to maintain consistency.
