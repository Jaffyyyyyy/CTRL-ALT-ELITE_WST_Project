# Project Rules

This document outlines the rules and constraints for the project.

For this subject’s Milestones and Terminal Assessment Output, here are some additional instructions:

List of Allowed and Not Allowed Technologies
a. Allowed
i. HTML5 (semantic tags, ARIA where needed)
ii. CSS3 (plain CSS, CSS variables)
iii. JavaScript (ES6+) – no transpilers/build tools
iv. Bootstrap 5 (CSS + JS bundle) via CDN only
v. Local assets you created (images/SVG) or free assets with attribution (served locally)
vi. LocalStorage/SessionStorage and static JSON files (for demo data)

b. Not Allowed
i. Any JS frameworks or libs (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Alpine, jQuery, Lodash, Axios, etc.)
ii. CSS frameworks other than Bootstrap (Tailwind, Bulma, etc.)
iii. Bootstrap Icons or any icon/font library via CDN (use inline SVG/Unicode or locally hosted SVGs)
iv. Build tools & package managers (npm, yarn, vite, webpack, gulp)
v. Server-side code or external APIs (no Firebase, no headless CMS)
vi. AI code-generation for whole components

No copy-pasting pre-built templates or component libraries.

If you used AI for minor help (e.g., grammar in README, refactoring a function), add a short note in README ("AI assistance: description").

Final code must be your own, understandable, and explainable during demo.
